# The-Gen-Pass
summer 20109 project 
Specifications: 

The program has a list of top sites that users need logins and stores the values that are called upon when the user selects the website –
	Storing the password requirements on a separate program that will be called upon to insert the data. 
	The independent site that will be updated quarterly or when users inform the company that the requirements have changed. 
	There will be a drop box with preloaded sites that the users can choose from like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Bank of America, and Gmail. 
	The drop box will be in alphabetical order. 
	Allows for generating a password based on contextual information provided by the user. 

The project will include two members, Mike Grant and Thomas Andreas. They will develop the code for the application by using python as their programming language. This app allows users to maintain top-notch security for their accounts by making their passwords far more unpredictable than before.
